**Data collection**


* See [AVDS’ recommendations for inc racial equity at OHSU doc](https://zenodo.org/record/3948281) to fill out this section
* Figure out what data your institution collects around racial equity (eg diversity of the applicant pool vs. who was interviewed vs. who was hired?) and ask that they publish an annual racial equity report that reports on these data

**Working with other student or racial equity groups on campus**


* AVDS’ strategies are largely founded on building towards long-term change in a sustainable manner. People who are new to social justice work often burn out quickly by trying to solve all problems immediately, but AVDS believes there needs to be a lot of solid groundwork laid in order to truly address these issues and cause culture shifts. This slow approach may not align with other groups on campus, but that’s okay, you should respect that different groups may take different approaches

**Working with administration**


* Working with administration is difficult because they can quickly become defensive around issues of racial equity and institutions are primarily concerned with saving money and only taking steps that present the appearance of progress. However, AVDS believes that it’s best to first try to work *with* administration and not against them. If you can frame your asks in the context of mutual goals, you are more likely to receive their help. However, staying in the good graces of administration doesn’t mean sacrificing the principles of your group, so it can be a fine line to tread. Add more content here
