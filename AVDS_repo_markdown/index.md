Currently, the AVDS repo is divided into 4 main sections, each with a corresponding document located in this drive:


1. Getting started: general first steps and considerations for beginning to develop a racial equity group at your university
2. General strategies: larger strategies your group should consider adopting (eg data collection and documentation, how to approach administration, etc)
3. FAQs: common questions about racial equity work (eg how to motivate faculty to become involved)
4. Canned REI answers: list of questions people in the group might anticipate when speaking about your work and suggestions for how to respond 

**The organization and structure of the repo is still in development, so thoughts and comments are very welcome re: removal or addition of sections, refinement of organization within each section, etc. Feel free to share these comments in the AVDS repo slack channel or comment directly on this or other documents**
