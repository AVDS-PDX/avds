**Logistics to consider/FAQs:**

**Should we become an official student group at our institution?**

This will depend on the specifics of your institution and what the costs and benefits of being an official student group might be. For instance, common benefits include guaranteed funding (universities often give student groups a certain amount of money per year), access to listservs, and inclusion in university communications around “diversity” events and activities around campus. Cons might include censoring and limitations and what you are allowed to do and say.

**How do we motivate faculty to care about these issues and get involved?**


* One possible solution is to push for *mandated implicit bias training*. However, no one can be forced to engage with this topic and doing so runs the risk of making people resentful for having to do this kind of training. Furthermore, implicit bias training does not equal anti-racism training and may actually accomplish very little in terms of a culture shift. However, universities are more likely to be amenable to enacting implicit bias training, so it could be a good first step to simply bridge the subject if racial equity isn’t a common topic of conversation at your university
* Get faculty involved on their own terms by forming a faculty committee for your group
* Incentivize faculty to be involved: (need to complete) 

**How to address lack of racial diversity in faculty**

-note: talk about how AVDS believes that you must first focus on establishing a supportive environment for BIPOC before focusing on recruitment. Bringing people into an unsupportive environment will be very harmful for them and doesn’t address the underlying issue

**How do we hold faculty accountable for racist behavior?** 

**Notes from Hillary for this section:**


* Do punitive models work? For example, mandating a remediation training after a faculty member commits a microaggression. My concern is that the ordeal may discourage them from taking on BIPOC students in their lab in the future.
* Long term, do we want to challenge the tenure system? How can we mandate consequences for egregious behavior? And what would be reasonable parameters for this?
* use a restorative justice model to hear from those who were harmed about how they think the situation could be repaired and have a facilitator guide the faculty through this process?

**Common terms**

It’s important to make a constant effort to humanize and decolonize the language used by your group in your documents. This is often an evolving process as new terms are introduced into the discourse. Some examples include:


* POC vs BIPOC
* URM vs PEER

**How to manage volunteers and deal with the problem where people join but don’t actively volunteer for tasks**

Typically it’s helpful to give people roles, an idea of what tasks they will be managing, and estimate of how much time it will take them per week or month

**How to create an AVDS chapter that happens to be all white? How do we actually support BIPOC with these limitations?**
