**Purpose**

The purpose of forming an AVDS repository is so that other groups who are interested in starting a similar group at their institution can follow our model for success. Racial equity work is extremely challenging and often comes with a unique set of barriers, many of which are presented by the institutions themselves given that making real progress often requires money and changing the status quo, both of which are commonly antithetical to how universities operate. The repo will contain documents that explain simple steps for getting started, common barriers one may encounter and how to tackle them, as well as an abundance of materials developed by AVDS that can be used as template materials (including surveys, SOPs, onboarding materials, bylaws, Code of Conduct, etc). 

**Pie in the sky goal**

Ultimately, this repo may serve as a foundation for making AVDS a national group with local chapters.
